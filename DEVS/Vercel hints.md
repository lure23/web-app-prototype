# Vercel hints

## Learnings

- [New features for SvelteKit: Optimize your application with ease](https://vercel.com/blog/feature-complete-sveltekit) (blog, Jun '23)


## Community support?

There is only a GitHub Discussion for discussing Vercel problems.

- Don't want discussions to be around "forever"
- Who else uses GitHub Discussions for wide scale support??

A StackOverflow Teams, or Discord would be way nicer!

See:
